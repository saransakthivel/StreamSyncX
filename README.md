Project Name: StreamSyncX
Description:
StreamSyncX is a real-time data acquisition and synchronization system that fetches XML data from multiple IoT devices across various locations and stores it in an SQL database. The system leverages Redis for caching and Dramatiq for asynchronous task execution, ensuring efficient and scalable data processing.

Key Features:
✅ Multi-Device Data Fetching – Collects XML data from hundreds of API endpoints.
✅ Real-Time Streaming – Fetches and processes data with minimal latency.
✅ Redis Caching – Reduces redundant API calls for optimized performance.
✅ Dramatiq Task Processing – Handles background jobs asynchronously for scalability.
✅ SQL Storage – Ensures structured data persistence for analysis and reporting.
✅ Scalable & Fault-Tolerant – Designed to support multiple locations efficiently.
